I am a physician and neuroscientist whose research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie human cognition and behavior through functional and structural neuroimaging. 

My work integrates fMRI, DTI, and EEG analyses with computational and machine learning approaches to examine how brain network alterations relate to cognitive and affective symptoms in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. 

Alongside my research, I teach physiology, neuroimaging, and programming for neuroscience students, and supervise graduate projects that bridge experimental design, data analysis, and translational neuroscience.
