Beyond my primary teaching and research activities, I have been actively involved in a range of academic, organizational, and creative projects that complement my scientific work and reflect my multidisciplinary background.

I have served as a senior researcher or project lead in several **nationally funded research grants** focusing on neuroimaging and neuromodulation. These include projects investigating **functional connectivity and apathy in Parkinson’s disease**, **multimodal biomarker-based stratification in Alzheimer’s disease**, and **the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on cognitive and network-level processes**. I have also contributed to studies exploring **glymphatic function**, **resting-state connectivity after traumatic brain injury**, and **virtual lesion paradigms in parietal cortex using TMS**. These projects have strengthened my expertise in **experimental design, data integration, and collaborative interdisciplinary research**.

In addition to my teaching duties, I regularly **supervise MSc and PhD students** in neuroscience and neuroimaging. I place particular emphasis on helping students develop technical independence — from coding and data preprocessing to experimental design and interpretation — while encouraging critical thinking and reproducible science. I have supervised completed and ongoing theses focused on **fMRI, DTI, and EEG analyses** in both healthy and clinical populations.

My experience also extends to **science communication and academic organization**. I co-organized and designed the website for our **Neuroscience Compass – Brain–Cognition Research Summer Camp** ([sinirbilimpusulasi.medipol.edu.tr](https://sinirbilimpusulasi.medipol.edu.tr)), where we provided hands-on neuroimaging training for young researchers. This experience reflects my interest in **making complex scientific tools accessible** and creating **educational infrastructures** that promote collaborative learning.

Before my academic career, I worked as a **medical doctor** in emergency medicine, where I gained first-hand insight into the human side of clinical decision-making and patient care. That experience continues to shape my scientific perspective — connecting mechanistic neuroimaging findings with their real-world clinical relevance and human impact.

Together, these experiences reflect my approach as both a researcher and educator: **combining technical precision with interdisciplinary curiosity**, mentoring with empathy, and scientific inquiry with a focus on translation and accessibility.
